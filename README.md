# NBA-Player-Performance-Predictor

This project analyzes historical NBA game data to explore player performance and predict points scored per game. It demonstrates end-to-end data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

### Key Highlights:

- Cleaned and prepared NBA player-game datasets for analysis.

- Performed exploratory analysis to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.

- Built regression models to predict individual player scoring based on game context and historical performance.

- Evaluated model performance using standard metrics and interpreted key predictive features.

- Tools Used: Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

### Potential Extensions:

- Incorporate additional features like opponent defense ratings or fatigue factors.

- Explore advanced models such as tree-based ensembles.

- Deploy a dashboard for real-time scoring predictions.
